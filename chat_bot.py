# Create a function called get_bot_response(). This function must:

# It should have 1 parameter called user_response, which is a string with the users input.

def get_bot_response()(user_response):

# It should return a string with the chat bot’s response.

# It should use at least 2 lists to store at least 3 unique responses to different user inputs. For example, if you were building a mood bot and the user entered “happy” for how they were feeling your happy response list could store something like “I’m glad to hear that!”, “Yay!”, “That is awesome!”.

# Use conditionals to decide which of the response lists to select from. For example: if a user entered “sad”, my program would choose a reponse from the of sad response list. If a user entered “happy”, my program would choose a reponse from the of happy response list.

# Use choice() to randomly select one of the three responses. (See example from class.)

# Greet the user using print() statements and explain what the chat bot topic is and what kind of responses it expects.

# Get user input using the input() function and pass that user input to the get_bot_response() function you will write

# Print out the chat bot’s response that is returned from the get_bot_response() function

# Use a while() loop to keep running your chat bot until the user enters "done".
